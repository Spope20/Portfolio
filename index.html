                <h2>Data Analyst/Computer Programmer </h2>
                <p>I am a former Actuarial Science student who has decided to seek a field.</p>
                <p>After working with coding throughout school and the start of my career I have discovered it's a passion of mine.
                  I now look to find a career where I can fully invest in that ability while also utilizing my past as a mathematics major.</p>
                <p>I have spent the past 3 years working on programming various insurance models. 2 years were spent working on models in python and a special programing environment.
                  the year before that I got to learn APL to work on life models and develop in VBA. During school I got to learn Java, R, SQL and C++ under my degree.
                  I look forward to enriching these skills even further in the future.</p>

                <p>The NC Air Qual project was a group project that features a machine learning model trained on historical data from North Carolina.
                This model aims predict the Air Quality Index based on a given set of dates and locations.
                For this group I handled building the initial ML model and general project managment and cleanup.</p>

                <p>Personal Calendar is a recreation of an excel project I worked on at brighthouse. My team lead requested an excel file to track team pto and avalability.
                the file would need to be hosted on a company cloud storage solution that opened the file in office 365. when recreating the file i adjusted it for personal use and created a version that utilizes
                macros unavalable in office 365. the xlsx version would be what you could host on the cloud. The calendar adjust to the current month in the default config and shows 3 months at a time.
                events that display on the calendar will need to be listed in a table on the Events sheet. old events are flagged in red and for the xlsm version, macros can add events and remove old events</p>

                  all the elements of the earthquake mapping can be toggled. the earthquakes are maped with circles that change size and color based on magnitude. 
                  A legend on the bottom right shows what range of magnitudes each color represents. When the user clicks on an earthquake a infobox will pop up showing magnitude and location</p>
